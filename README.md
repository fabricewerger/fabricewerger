## Introduction

My name is Fabrice Werger, a software developer based near Rotterdam and Breda, the Netherlands. Originally trained as a multimedia designer and critical thinker at Avans University of Applied Sciences in Breda. My interests lie in the field of front-end development and creative technologies, and my main goal is to become better at being a creative developer.

### Recent projects

I have worked on a number of projects during my time at Avans Hogeschool/Hogeschool Inholland. Here are some of my most recent projects:

#### StartupBureau
IOS development for Inholland Haarlem, made with swift/swiftUI. Made to communicate with an API/database specifically made for the client.

#### Sensual suit

Creative embodied-experience for [CMD Breda](https://avanscmd.nl/), in collaboration with [May de haas](https://instagram.nl/maydehaas) and [Shimin Chen](https://instagram.nl/shiminchn). A project that can give you control over your emotions. An almost autonomous suit that works with C++, air, servomotors and heatpads.
